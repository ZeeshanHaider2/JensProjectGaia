          <p>
            For more than fifty years the present writer has been deeply engaged
            in and concerned about the future of humankind in the light of
            industrial civilisation's extremely problematic relationship with
            the rest of the biosphere due to population growth, depletion of
            natural resources and harmful impact on the environment: not only
            global warming - much talked about, but next to nothing done with -
            , but also degra.dation of ecosystems, loss of biodiversity,
            extinction of species, extensive erosion of agricultural soil,
            worldwide pollution with toxic chemicals and plastics etc. Trying to
            influence public opinion in Denmark I took some years ago the
            initiative for and partly planned two international conferences in
            the Danish Parliament. The first one was about peak oil and the
            replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy with the British
            oil geologist Colin Campbell as the main speaker who one and a half
            year later founded ASPO = Association for the Stdy of Peak Oil abd
            Gas. The second one originally was entitled "Is the World Moving
            Towards or Away From Ecological Sustainability?" and had the
            subtitle: "And if away what can we do about it?" In parallel with my
            many years of studies and thinking about the above-mentioned
            problems I have built up a substantial private library not only
            covering ecology and human ecology as well as the other natural and
            technical sciences, but also the social sciences and humanities.
            Topics of special interest has been ideas as drivers in human
            history, the two revolutions in communications in human history:
            writing and the printing press and their consequences, the Era of
            Enlightenment in the 17. and 18. centuries, the Industrial
            Revolution in Great Britain (1760-1820) and its ensuing spread to
            the rest of the world, and the Second World War and its origins. My
            reading has led me to some very different conclusions concerning how
            to diminish the risk of an ecological megacatastrophe and a collapse
            of industrial civilisation we are heading towards with lightening
            speed. As expressed in the following discussion paper which has been
            sent out to the international experts I have been in personal
            contact with and other experts.
